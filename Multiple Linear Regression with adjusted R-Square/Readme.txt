In this repository I am going through a course exercise learning how to us sklearn to pull statistics from a dataset to build  multiple linear regression model using 
using machine learning as well as calculate adjusted r-square using multiple variables. The objective of this exercise is to utilize sklearn with multiple variables and 
calculate adjusted R-square score.
